# It could probably have been made a bit prettier but it does the job just fine. 
# The 'biggest' issues I had was that I had to cast the inputs as ints / floats, 
# and initially I forgot to make the tip a percentage number - instead i multiplied it with the split bill. Oops.
# It works as it is here, however.
